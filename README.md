- [lol-cubes/cygraph](https://github.com/lol-cubes/cygraph): A fast and flexible graph theory library with C++, Cython, and Python APIs
- [lol-cubes/cl-timer](https://github.com/lol-cubes/cl-timer): A cubing timer for the terminal
- [lol-cubes/cubesolve](https://github.com/lol-cubes/cubesolve): A command-line Rubiks' Cube solver
